`ng-milkdown-crepe` is based on üçº[milkdown](https://milkdown.dev)'s [crepe](https://milkdown.dev/docs/guide/using-crepe) implementation of [ Angular](https://angular.dev/) editor component that works out-of-the-box and supports custom configurations.

## Examples

### Basic

### Theme

Like `milkdown`, `ng-milkdown-crepe` supports custom themes by importing theme styles:

```typescript
import "@milkdown/crepe/theme/common/style.css";
import "@milkdown/crepe/theme/nord.css";
```

See the [milkdown](https://milkdown.dev/docs/guide/using-crepe#theme) documentation for more themes.

### Features and feature settings

You can set the characteristics of `crepe` through the `features` attribute and `featureOptions` attribute, please refer to the [milkdown](https://milkdown.dev/docs/guide/using-crepe#feature-toggle-and- config) for details.
In the following example, the suffix `_1` is added to the text and grouping labels of the slash option, and the `CodeMirror` feature is disabled:

::iframe{src="/#/crepe-example-feature"}

--------------

### Events

`ng-milkdown-crepe` supports `beforeReady` and `onReady` events, the `beforeReady` event is triggered before the editor is initialized, and the `onReady` event is triggered after the editor is initialized.
The `beforeReady` event allows you to perform some initialization operations on the editor, such as setting the editor content, setting read-only, etc.
